      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hello there, my name is Marius Ciocoiu.</p>
      <p>
        I am a self-taught developer who is extremely passionate about web
        development, linux, blockchain technology, decentralized protocols and
        finance. I'm constantly learning and looking for new experiences to grow
        both as a professional and as a person.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a naturally curious nerd, obsessed with beautiful products and my
        major influence is minimalism. When I’m not working, I’m either spending
        time with my family and friends, reading, travelling the world, smashing
        the gym or enjoy an excellent cup of coffee. I believe in living better
        with less.
      </p>
